# FIXME : ~training.model.position_embedding_type was added in the extra_cmd_args in order to fix a bug from NeMo repository (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo).
# the commit that should fix this issue in NeMo is : 5b296e8af832c67d361fdfb80a165db3affaf76a.
# Once the new release of NeMoLauncher includes this commit (check by downloading the corresponding container and look inside /opt for this commit), ~training.model.position_embedding_type should be removed from the extra args
